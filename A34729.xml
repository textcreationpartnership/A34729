            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> VerÅ¿e, the words are theÅ¿e: <hi>And they were both naked; And they were both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> Beloved, Å¿uch is the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of theÅ¿e words that I am loath to loÅ¿e the taÅ¿te of them out of my mouth, but to Å¿atisfie the expectation of this faire aÅ¿Å¿embly, according to the motion of the Spirit I Å¿hall prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ie: Marke, beloved, and give attention to the Å¿ound of the words: <hi>And they were both naked:</hi> They are words indeed of pleaÅ¿ure for all the Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. No queÅ¿tion but the Prophet <hi>GeneÅ¿is</hi> himÅ¿elfe was naked when hee writ theÅ¿e words. Beloved by theÅ¿e words underÅ¿tand a twofold naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66274:3"/> The firÅ¿t is a nakedneÅ¿Å¿e, or being voyd or expert of garments to cover the body: whereunto a nakedneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿in is incident, and appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the naked of Garments; or to explaine it more fully, they that weare no cloathes, weare no coverings for Å¿in.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd is a nakedneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿tone-walls, and windowes full of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous pictures, Organs that bellow like the BeaÅ¿t of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to interpret it more plainly: NakedneÅ¿Å¿e of a Church, is the third nakedneÅ¿Å¿e meant and underÅ¿tood in my Text: of all which, by the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Spirit, in their order. And firÅ¿t for nakedneÅ¿Å¿e of garments<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
            </p>
            <p>ThoÅ¿e that are naked, and uncloathed have no covering for their Å¿ins, whereas, thoÅ¿e that are cloathed in fine raiment, like <hi>Dives</hi> Å¿poken of in the EvangeliÅ¿t, have the viÅ¿ible markes of the beaÅ¿t: they are proud, haughtie, and ambitious, they are gluttons and Å¿urfet with the Banners of pride: many weare Cloaks for their Å¿ins, yea, brethren and Å¿iÅ¿ters double Cloaks, yea though they be Å¿hort Cloaks, yet they are lin'd with PluÅ¿h, they are out-landiÅ¿h pluÅ¿h cloaks, they Å¿mell of curÅ¿ed <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Others my beloved brethren and SiÅ¿ters, weare Cloaks of red Scarlet, Å¿ide, large, and downe to the hams, which are indeed covers for their Å¿ins that are as red as Å¿carlet; they are popiÅ¿h and idolatrous, for they are invented by the French: they weare alÅ¿o locks, like the curled locks of AntichriÅ¿t, to cover their eares, as if they were all Scriveners: long haire is the enÅ¿igne of pride, and the world is full of theÅ¿e enÅ¿ignes. Nay my beloved, thoÅ¿e that are the chiefe heads and Governours of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the puniÅ¿hers of vice, maintaine it in themÅ¿elves, by wearing Å¿ide and long robes of Purple, and Scarlet, under which are hid innumerable multitudes of iniquities. Nay, moreover, my beloved Brethren and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, the popiÅ¿h BiÅ¿hops doe gird Å¿in to them, and keep it cloÅ¿e, as if they were in love with it, under their Canonicall CaÅ¿Å¿ocks, which are bound to them with Leviticall SurÅ¿ingles, and upon them they wear large Surplices, made of fine linnen, like <hi>Dives</hi> that is Å¿poken of before, and they weare upon them Gownes of beyond-Å¿ea Satlens; the very name whereof is Idolatrie, becauÅ¿e it is a couÅ¿in German to Saten: thus much for Habits. Now to the next poynt of Nakednes, which is nakedneÅ¿Å¿e of a Church, <hi>They were naked,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, without a Church.</p>
            <p>Now beloved, we muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider what a Church is. A very zealous Brother had the unhappineÅ¿Å¿e to be a bookiÅ¿h Scholler, and to underÅ¿tand the prophane language of <hi>Rome,</hi> but before his death he was verie peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for it, and Å¿orrowed exceedingly. He Å¿aid the name of a Church in the Idolatrous Latin tongue was <hi>EccleÅ¿ia,</hi> which is derived from a Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which Å¿ignifies to call, and that is the reaÅ¿on thoÅ¿e
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66274:4"/> prophane things called Bells were firÅ¿t invented Å¿o call the people to the Church. Beloved, I Å¿ay it is Idolatrie to have Bells in t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

TheÅ¿e wicked beloved, Å¿ing their prayers in prick Å¿ong, they keep men and boyes purpoÅ¿ely for Å¿inging, which are clothed in white Raiments, they provide houÅ¿es for them in <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>forme theÅ¿e Å¿uperÅ¿titious offices in their Cloathes, which is more abhominable than all the reÅ¿t; for were their actions never Å¿o good, being done in their cloaths, it is moÅ¿t prophane. Moreover beloved in theÅ¿e Churches there are great windowes, nay pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted windowes, I Å¿ay unto you windowes full of Images and Pictures; and the wicked doe kneele when they pray, and doe look upon theÅ¿e Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which is meere poperie it Å¿elfe: they alÅ¿o marrie and give in marri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age in thoÅ¿e Churches, which is altogether to be abhor'd, which is a great hindrance to propagation, when a man is tyed to one woman.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e my dearely beloved, are infallible Å¿ignes of poperie nouriÅ¿hed in their hearts, and expreÅ¿Å¿ed in their actions: but there is one thing more cheriÅ¿hed and favoured as their chiefe darling, which I am afraid is a Å¿in Å¿o name. Beleeve me brethren, it Å¿ticks in my iawes very hard, it is a CroÅ¿Å¿e, 'tis a CroÅ¿Å¿e I Å¿ay: Do not they Å¿et upon their Idolatrous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66274:4"/> the CroÅ¿Å¿e? Do not they build in the middle of their Cities CroÅ¿Å¿es and put heads of Gold upon them? Do they not make Percullices for the Citie gates with croÅ¿Å¿e beames in them? Do they not Å¿uffer the Lettices, or enÅ¿ignes of the houÅ¿e of the beaÅ¿t with Å¿even heads and ten hornes, I meane of Tavernes and Ale houÅ¿es, to bee made with croÅ¿Å¿e barres? Doe they not Å¿et up Å¿ignes to their houÅ¿es, (which Å¿hew there is nothing but poperie within) of the CroÅ¿Å¿e Keyes? Doe they not picture Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> a croÅ¿Å¿e his Gridfron? Doe they not make the bottome of their Andirons in croÅ¿Å¿es? Are not their bed cords a croÅ¿Å¿e? Are not the Leads in their windowes a croÅ¿Å¿e? are not their two-handed Å¿words made in forme of a CroÅ¿Å¿e? Is not their coyne, as Å¿hillings, Å¿ix pences, and the like, full of CroÅ¿Å¿es? Our well affected brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> are enemies to thoÅ¿e Idolatrous croÅ¿Å¿es, who make their two pences with RoÅ¿es and ThiÅ¿tles upon them? have not their gold of 11. Å¿hillings the Daggers a croÅ¿Å¿e? Doe they not lay Sacks upon the backs of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es a croÅ¿Å¿e? Are not the Spokes of Coach-wheeles a CroÅ¿Å¿e? are not the horÅ¿es harneÅ¿Å¿es made a croÅ¿Å¿e: And moreover, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould not have enough of CroÅ¿Å¿es, doe they not name their Å¿treets Red CroÅ¿Å¿e Å¿treet, and White-croÅ¿Å¿e Å¿treet? Nay more than this, doe they not Å¿et watch-men every night to attend the headleÅ¿Å¿e CroÅ¿Å¿e in <hi>Barbicane</hi> with Halberts that are a croÅ¿Å¿e?

            <p>But beloved brethren, and more beloved Å¿iÅ¿ters, it is no wonder, though they be altogether Idolatrous, when their verie bread that is their chiefe nouriÅ¿hment, is CroÅ¿Å¿e Buns, which is Idolatrous, and is made of corne that is ground by a wicked Miller, who hath carried it in a Sack croÅ¿Å¿e his Å¿houlders, I Å¿ay, croÅ¿Å¿e his Å¿holders, and hath ground it in a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, the Sailes whereof are croÅ¿Å¿e: And my beloved, as if this were not Idolatrie Å¿ufficient, they cloath their Å¿ailes with cloathes, and never thinke of the golden Å¿aying, <hi>And they were both naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We therefore, my dearely affected, that are voyd of theÅ¿e Å¿uperÅ¿titious coverings, not onely <hi>Cloathes,</hi> but alÅ¿o <hi>Churches,</hi> for we propheÅ¿ie in the open fields as our Father <hi>Adam</hi> did in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> muÅ¿t needs be in the Å¿tate of innocence, as he was, for we have not Å¿o much as fig-leaves upon us: let us therefore reioyce exceedingly, and expreÅ¿Å¿e our ioy in the lively act of Generation, and propagation of the godly, that may bee borne naked as we are at this preÅ¿ent.
